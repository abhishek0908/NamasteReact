--Class Based Component
    -- we takes props in the constructor 
    -- super(props) is compulsory why(H.W)
    --  we use this keyword in component to display 
    --  constructor is best place to create state variable
    --  in this we dont create multiple variable and just create one big state varible and put all variable in that one
    -- never update state varibale directly it create inconsistency
-- Behind the scene react will create a one big object and put all state variable int that one

-- What is react component life cycle?(Imp Question)
    -- ComponentDidMount? this functiion will be called in this order?
    --contructor-> render method-> componentmount
    -- it is just like useEffect which is in function based component
    -- if we have multiple child then it will first render for both and then mount(Good Concept)

--ComponentDidUPDATE() call after update the data at first render it will call didmount and for another it will call update one

-- MOUNTING
    --Constructor (dummy)
    --Render (dummy) 
    --<HTML Dummy >
    -- Component Did Mount
    --<API Call>
    --<this.setState>
    --State variable is updated
    
    ---UPDATE
    --render (APi data)
    --<HTML (new API data>)
    --componentDid Update


--Componentwillunmount() - > when we go to another page we unmount prev page
    -- this things we do prev but nowdays we simplified it a lot
    -- to understand why we use componentwillunmount to watch last 45 min of EP8 Hint(Because it is single page application) 
    -- when we create a mess we have to clear it also

-- we do unmount in function based component also using return within the useeffect callback functiion
--why we cant use async in useeffect(H.W)
